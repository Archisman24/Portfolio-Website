                        On a constant search for ideas and approach to refine fuel efficiency and performance of 4-wheeler, vehicle aerodynamics is a crucial research area which cannot be neglected, as it plays a vital role in stability, handling, and fuel economy. 
                        This project deals with Dimple Effect which is seen in golf balls used as an approach to create rough surface along the contour of the vehicle body to create turbulent boundary layer which results in decrease in drag force, delays the flow separation and improves the downforce. 
                        We have taken into consideration of studying the effects of the dimple in regular 4-wheeler vehicles by studying pressure contour, streamlines of airflow and calculating drag force for different dimple depth ratio and different positioning of the dimples over a wide range of air speed. Fuel economy is a key aspect for commercial vehicles and taxi cars as they are on road all the time. With their boxy, less aerodynamic design itâ€™s very hard to achieve a good mileage. 
                        This project is about using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) as a tool to calculate the aerodynamic parameters of a car model and start modifying the dimples in critical areas to help overcome wind and improve fuel economy. 
                        We have deployed this technique on A, B and C pillars of a sedan (Figure).

                        During the early years of the automobile industry, vehicle aerodynamics were mainly incorporated into the design of racing cars. However, the main motivation to reduce resistance in mass-produced cars came in 1973, when a group of oil-exporting countries formed a cartel that drastically increased the price of oil while reducing production.

                        This has forced car companies to invest in designing cars that are fuel efficient. Fuel consumption depends on the efficiency of the engines, the transmission system, the shape of the car and the power required to overcome the resistance to movement. The aerodynamics of the car allows us to realize that it is not incredible that so many cars look so similar, but what actually makes cars different from others. In recent decades, there has been an underlying tension between aerodynamic engineers and automotive designers. Each side believes that function is compatible, that good design shouldn't get in the way of good aerodynamics, and that aerodynamics shouldn't limit design. In fact, the wind always wants your car to look like raindrops, whether the grille is noticeable or not., and anything else is a compromise. In India, the automotive industry accounts for 45% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of manufacturing, 7.1% of the country's GDP, and employs about 19 million people directly and indirectly, but is currently facing a decline due to economic difficulties, lack of technology testing, unmet market demand, high fuel prices, especially for commercial vehicles that are not aerodynamically viable.

                        An enlightened literature review shows that several attempts have been made to improve fuel efficiency by changing designs that could reduce the drag forces acting on the vehicle. CFD simulation technology has proven useful for understanding air-body interaction phenomena and for stimulating the real environment to optimize its performance, such as reducing air resistance. This project was initiated as a solution to the challenges and requirements as it investigates the effect of surface roughness on vehicles when simulated at different speeds. Dimpled depressions of various depths were investigated on the A, B, C columns subjected to increased resistance to see if this could reduce the resistance by even a trivial amount. This could pave the way for successful fuel economy improvements and emissions minimization.
